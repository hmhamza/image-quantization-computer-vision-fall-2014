# Image Quantization

This was a programming assignment for the Bachelors course Fundamentals of Computer Vision in my fifth semester (Fall 2014)

This is the MATLAB code with GUI. It performs several types of quantizations:

1. Gray level quantization
2. Quantization using Mean filter
3. Quantization using Median filter
4. Quantization using Decimation filter
